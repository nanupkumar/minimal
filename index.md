### Fraud Detection

FThe project broadly falls under the category of Risk Analytics. We work for a consumer finance company which is specialised in lending various types of loans to urban customers. Upon receiving a loan application, the company has to approve/reject the request based on the applicant’s profile. The following are two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision,

Loss of business: Not approving the loan even if the applicant is likely to repay.
Financial Loss: Approving the loan when the applicant is likely to default.
The aim of this case study is to identify the traits of risky loan applicants using Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. This knowledge helps the company during Risk Assessment process and approving loan for the right applicants thereby avoiding potential loss of business and also at the same time minimising the financial/credit loss*. *Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay the money owed.
